# Traffic-Simulation
This is a personal project that would simulate traffic on a map
This project was inspired Juraj Majerik Uber Clone project, I want to build something similar that exposes me to the full SDLC of a distributed system.
This will have a similar approach of simulating rides, but focusing on traffic and picking up the best router a trip make to get from point A to point B.
